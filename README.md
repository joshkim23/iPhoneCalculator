iPhone Calculator using Vanilla JS 

This is yet another pure Vanilla JS projects where I worked with keystroke events, utilizing objects with multiple types to modularize the handling of many different events, and more complex algorithmic programming to enable to user to do any combination of operations made possible with this configuration of a calculator. 

The design was taken from Timothy Robards where he uploaded his take on codepen (https://codepen.io/trobes/pen/EerrNd)
